# Syntax Off

Syntax Off is a Visual Studio Code theme that removes syntax highlighting. Two
variants are provided, _Syntax Off Light_ and _Syntax Off Dark_. These are based
respectively on the _Light+_ and _Dark+_ themes distributed with Visual Studio
Code.

In addition to removing syntax highlighting, Syntax Off themes the activity bar
and status bar to match the surrounding editor components (in _Light+_ and
_Dark+_ the status bar is bright blue, and in _Light+_ the activity bar is dark
in an otherwise light theme).
